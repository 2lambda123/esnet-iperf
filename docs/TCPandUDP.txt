TCP 

divides the data(coming from the application layer) into proper sized chunks and then passes these chunks onto the network. 
It acknowledges received packets, waits for the acknowledgments of the packets it sent and sets timeout to resend the packets 
if acknowledgements are not received in time. The term ‘reliable connection’ is used where it is not desired to loose any information
that is being transferred over the network through this connection. So, the protocol used for this type of connection must provide the 
mechanism to achieve this desired characteristic. For example, while downloading a file, it is not desired to loose any information(bytes) 
as it may lead to corruption of downloaded content.



UDP

provides a comparatively simpler but unreliable service by sending packets from one host to another. 
UDP does not take any extra measures to ensure that the data sent is received by the target host or not. 
The term ‘unreliable connection’ are used where loss of some information does not hamper the task being 
fulfilled through this connection. For example while streaming a video, loss of few bytes of information 
due to some reason is acceptable as this does not harm the user experience much.
