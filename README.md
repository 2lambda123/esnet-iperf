## Repository Purpose

This repository is a fork of the original [iPerf3 repository](https://github.com/esnet/iperf) 
specifically adapted for use with the OpenMobileNetworkToolkit developed by Fraunhofer FOKUS. 
The primary goal of this fork is to make iPerf3 compatible with 
Android Apps by replacing `exit()` calls with `longjmp();`. 
Adapted versions of iPerf will be tagged with the format v3.XX.

#### Current adapted version is iPerf 3.15.
